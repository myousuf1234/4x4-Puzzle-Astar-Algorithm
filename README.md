# 4x4-Puzzle-Astar-Algorithm
The problem description is as follows:
15-puzzle problem: On a 4 x 4 board there are 15 tiles numbered from 1 to 15 and a blank position. A tile can slide into the blank position if it is horizontally or vertically adjacent to the blank position. 
Given a start board configuration and a goal board configuration, find a sequence of moves to reach the goal configuration from the start configuration. The goal is to find a solution with minimum number of moves.

The tasks demanded of me are as follows:
Implement the GRAPH-SEARCH Algorithm with A* Search Strategy for
solving the 15-puzzle problem as described below. Use sum of Manhattan distances of tiles from
their goal positions as heuristic function. [Reminder: the GRAPH-SEARCH Algorithm does
not allow repeated states.]

The user must provide an input file. The program will produce an output file with the input board, the output board,
the moves needed to reach the solution, the depth of the solution, the f(n) values of every node on the solution path, 
and the number of nodes expanded.
